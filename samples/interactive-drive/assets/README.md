# Assets

This directory contains repo-local binary assets needed to run the self-contained demo.

## Scenes

Staged under `scenes/` by `prepare.py`, which pulls the USDZ from
[`nvidia/omni-dreams-scenes`](https://huggingface.co/datasets/nvidia/omni-dreams-scenes)
on Hugging Face. The default scene is
`scenes/clipgt-01d503d4-449b-46fc-8d78-9085e70d3554.usdz`; run
`python prepare.py --scene-uuid <clipgt-...>` to stage a different
scene from the dataset.

The default GUI launch configs and README examples use the default scene
so the demo no longer depends on a scene path outside the current workspace.
