"""Resolve which Hugging Face organisation hosts the omni-dreams repos.

The interactive demo fetches scene assets from Hugging Face:

  * ``<org>/omni-dreams-scenes``   -- interactive-drive USDZ scenes

The flashdreams world-model backend owns its own model/checkpoint fetches.

The default org is ``"nvidia"``. Environments that use another authorized
Hugging Face org can flip every fetch to that org by either:

  * passing ``--hf-org <org>`` on the CLI, **or**
  * exporting ``OMNI_DREAMS_HF_ORG=<org>``.

Every entry point that adds the CLI flag pokes the env var in ``main()``
before the rest of the module graph imports anything that fetches, which
keeps the resolution centralised here -- no thread-the-arg-through plumbing.
