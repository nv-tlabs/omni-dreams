"""Tests for :class:`KeyboardState`'s :class:`RuntimeControls` contract.

The display loop depends on the rising-edge consume semantics for reset:
exactly one ``consume_reset_request`` call returns ``True`` per call to
``request_reset``, and rapid presses must coalesce so a single reset isn't
processed twice.
